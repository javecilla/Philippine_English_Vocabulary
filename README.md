# Philippine-English Vocabulary Web App

  I developed the Philippine-English Vocabulary Web App as a commissioned project for fourth-year Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSED) students majoring in English at Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP). Designed to enhance vocabulary mastery, this web app offers interactive learning tools, pronunciation guides, and quizzes to support effective language acquisition.

  ## Key Features  
  - **Extensive Word Collection**: Covers Philippine English words with clear meanings.  
  - **Pronunciation Guide**: Includes audio support to ensure correct pronunciation.  
  - **Contextual Usage**: Sample sentences demonstrate real-world application.  
  - **Visual Aids**: Pictures enhance memory retention.  
  - **Interactive Quizzes**: Users can test their knowledge and track progress.  
  - **User Customization**: Personalized settings for an adaptive learning experience.
  
  ## Project Timeline  
  - **August 2024 - Development & Launch**: Initiated after discussions with PUP students and built to meet their academic needs.
  
  ## Technical Challenges & Solutions  
  - **Audio Integration**: Implemented a seamless audio playback feature for pronunciation guides.  
  - **Optimized Database Queries**: Ensured fast retrieval of vocabulary data through efficient indexing.
  
  ## Impact  
  - Improved vocabulary retention for students using structured learning modules.  
  - Provided an accessible and engaging tool for self-paced learning.  
  
  ## Architecture  
  - **Backend**: PHP for API development and content management.  
  - **Frontend**: JavaScript with Bootstrap for a responsive UI.  
  - **Database**: MySQL with optimized queries for efficient word lookup.  
  - **Deployment**: Hosted on Hostinger for reliability and scalability.
  
  This project reinforced my expertise in full-stack web development, particularly in integrating multimedia elements and optimizing database performance. The challenge of making vocabulary learning interactive pushed me to refine user experience design and create a tool that balances education with engagement.
