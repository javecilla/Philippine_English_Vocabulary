# About

The **Philippine-English Vocabulary** app was developed in August 2024. The project began with a commission from Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) students, specifically fourth-year students pursuing a Bachelor of Secondary Education, Major in English. After discussing their requirements in an online meeting, I started building this app to meet their needs and ensure full functionality.
